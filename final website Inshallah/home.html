    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id = "nassr">As a speaker or as a writer, words fail me to describe a personality I have taken and will continue to take as a role model and ideal in my life in all aspects. I exaggerate my love for this person. He is unlike anyone else. He is Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary-General of Hezbollah and Master of the Martyrs of the Resistance. A knight without equal, a great martyr, a heroic, courageous, wise, insightful, and faithful leader, joining the caravan of the eternal, luminous martyrs of Karbala in the divine, faith-based journey following in the footsteps of the martyred prophets and imams.This site was built by someone who considers himself a servant of this great man.</p>

          Between 1985 and 2000, Nasrallah led numerous military operations against the Israeli occupation, which resulted in Israel's complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon without reaching any agreement or treaty with Lebanon.

        He led a war known as the 33-day war in 2006, following Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers in Operation True Promise, and they achieved a resounding victory, were it not for the Zionist entity's rush to the UN Security Council to issue Resolution 1701.
